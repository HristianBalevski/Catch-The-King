# Catch-The-King
Catch The King is a two-player game involving White and Black participants. The primary objective for each player is to capture the king before their opponent does. The first player commences the game from position (0, 0), while the second player starts at position (7, 7). The king initiates the game from a randomly determined position, with the caveat that every fifth iteration prompts a change in the king's location.

Each player has eight possible directions for movement, and they can advance by only one square in each move. The winner is the player who successfully captures the king. If neither player catches the king within the first 20 iterations, the king emerges victorious in the game.
